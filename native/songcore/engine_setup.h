// ─── The project → engine push ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything the app does to get a Project *into* the engine: the per-instrument playback params, the
// modulation slots, the EQ/send routing, the mixer, and the global FX state. Ported from
// RenderController.setupInstrumentParams + applyMasterBusForRender and AppInputDispatcher's
// syncVolumesToAudioBackend / pushGlobalEffectsToBackend.
//
// WHY IT HAS TO EXIST (S6b). The engine keeps mixer / master-bus / EQ-bank / send state across project
// swaps — none of it is per-voice — so "play this project" is not just scheduling notes: someone must
// push all of that down first. On Android that someone was Kotlin, which meant a host renderer
// (tools/ptrender) or the SDL shell could not make a sound at all, no matter how correct the
// scheduler was. S7 (deleting the Kotlin path) and Linux Phase 2 need exactly this file.
//
// Two halves, split by lifetime:
//
//   push_project_params  — pure param pushes, no I/O. Cheap, idempotent, safe to repeat. A render
//                          prepares with it; the SDL shell calls it after every load and edit.
//   load_project_media   — opens FILES (samples, SF2s) and *produces* the Routing. Used by ptrender
//                          and the SDL shell. Android still loads media in Kotlin, whose loader also
//                          drives MediaCodec for m4a and reads WAV cue points — see the note there.
//
// Float exactness: every derived value goes through voice_derive.h, whose derivations are byte-
// goldened against the real Kotlin code by tools/ptvoice (77 cases). Nothing is re-derived here.
//
// Template over the engine, like voice_derive.h — AudioEngine satisfies it as-is, and a recorder can
// be substituted in a host test without an interface or a virtual call.

/**
 * The same thing, for an app that is going to PLAY the project rather than export it — every
 * instrument rather than the used ones, and no `resetEffectState()` first (that would cut off whatever
 * is currently ringing).
 *
 * ⚠️ **This closes a real hole, and it is worth being precise about what the hole was.** Until Phase 3
 * S4 the ONLY caller of push_project_params in the whole tree was `prepare_render`. So a rendered WAV
 * carried the project's mixer, master bus, reverb, delay, EQ bank and every sampler's drive / filter /
 * crush / loop / sample window — and the SDL shell PLAYING that same project carried none of it. Live
 * playback ran on whatever the engine happened to hold: its own defaults at startup, or the previous
 * project's settings after a load. It was not audible on the default project (whose values happen to be
 * the engine's own), which is exactly why it survived Phase 2 and three Phase-3 sessions.
 *
 * The reason it could survive at all is that it is invisible to the conformance ladder: ptplay compares
 * EVENTS, and none of this is an event; ptvoice compares the calls a NOTE makes, and none of this is
 * made by a note; ptrender compares audio, and ptrender renders — so it goes through the one path that
 * was correct. Nothing in seven tools looks at what the engine holds while the app is merely running.
 *
 * Call it after a project is loaded, and again whenever a screen edits something in it that the engine
 * keeps on its own (the mixer, the master bus, an instrument's params — SongcoreHost::push_params /
 * push_instrument).
