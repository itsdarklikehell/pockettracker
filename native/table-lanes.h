// ─── THE THREE PLAYHEADS OF ONE TABLE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A table's columns do not advance together. Lane 0 carries `transpose`, `volume` and FX1; lane 1 is
// FX2 alone and lane 2 is FX3 alone. Each owns a row cursor AND a rate, so `HOP 00` in FX2 loops FX2
// while the rest of the table runs its sixteen rows, and a `TIC` in FX2 changes FX2's speed only.
//
// ⚠️ **THE LANE INDEX IS THE FX SLOT MINUS ONE**, everywhere — the row work, the ramps and the three
// markers on the TABLE screen all key off that one identity. `TableRamp::paramSlot` is 1-3 and is
// converted at exactly one place (`applyTableRamps`).
//
// ⚠️ ONE STRUCT FOR BOTH VOICE TYPES, because `processTableTick` is one template over them —
// parallel arrays per voice type would drift in the reset paths.

    int   lastProcessed = -1;   // the last row whose effects were applied; -1 = none yet
    int   ticRate       =  6;   // 01-FB musical tics per row; 00 trigger, FC octave, FE note, FF 200 Hz

    int   hopTarget     = -1;   // its target row; -1 = no HOP counting

    // ⚠️ `HOP FF` freezes THIS LANE, not the table. The voice's `tableId` only goes to -1 once all
    // three are down — a stop typed in FX3 must not silence the note and volume columns.
