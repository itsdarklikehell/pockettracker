// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The reverb's PRESETS — four names for four sets of cell values — and the names of the algorithms
// that read those cells.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **THE NAME IS NOT STORED IN THE PROJECT AND IS NOT AN ARGUMENT TO THE DSP.** A project holds
// DCAY, SIZE, DAMP, PRE, WIDE and MOD; the TYPE cell writes all six at once and then reads the name
// back by matching. Nothing downstream can ask "is this HALL?", because after one turn of any other
// cell the question has no answer — which is the point. A preset is a starting place, not a mode.
// Same shape as delay-presets.h, on purpose.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **`NORMAL`'S ROW IS THE STRUCT DEFAULT** (model.h): DCAY 60, SIZE 60, DAMP 80, PRE 00, WIDE 80,
// MOD 10 — and a project written before these cells existed loads without them and lands on that
// row, so the row and the struct must be changed TOGETHER or a brand-new project reads as USER. It
// is the one row whose values are not free.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **ONLY PRE AND WIDE ARE GATED OUT AT THEIR DEFAULTS**, which is what keeps an old project's
// pre-delay and stereo image exactly as they were. **DCAY, DAMP and MOD are not, and cannot be.**
// DCAY and DAMP spend the whole of 00–FF on tail lengths and brightnesses a musician would actually
// choose; MOD's default is low because a wander sized for a long tail is audible as detuning on a
// short one. SIZE is neutral at 60 by construction rather than by a gate: the room scale is exactly
// 1 there, so the lines are the lengths they always were.
//
// ⚠️ A preset row may be RE-TUNED freely — it is only a set of values a user can then edit.
//
// ⏸️ **PLATE IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT.** What makes a plate a plate is the DENSITY of its build-up, and
// this reverb's is eight delay lines: a "PLATE" here could only be a bright hall, and a preset list
// is a promise about what its names mean.
//
// ⚠️ This header pulls in `<cmath>` and NOTHING ELSE: the UI reads it (for the names and the match)
// and so does the DSP, and pulling in the reverb module would drag `EqModule` into every UI
// translation unit, where `pt::ui::EqModule` already lives.

// turns metallic without some, so CAVE has the most. It is the length that decides how much a row
// can carry, not how grand the name sounds.
