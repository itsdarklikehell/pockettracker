// DragonflyReverb — the Dragonfly Reverb suite's four plugins, run as the reverb send's algorithms
// 1..4: HALL, ROOM, PLATE (Dragonfly's "Nested") and FOIL ("Simple").
//
// Each is Dragonfly's own `plugins/*/DSP.cpp` set-up and signal flow over the freeverb3 subset in
// `freeverb/`, with the plugin's parameter surface replaced by the reverb section's cells. The
// mapping from a cell to a freeverb setter lives in the .cpp, beside the engine that reads it.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **FREEVERB REALLOCATES ITS DELAY LINES WHEN A ROOM'S SIZE OR THE RATE CHANGES** (`setRSFactor`,
// `setSampleRate`, `loadPresetReflection`), so the audio thread never does either. `prepare` — the
// control thread, whenever the algorithm, SIZE or the rate changes — builds a whole
// engine at those values and hands it over; `process` takes it at its next block and parks the one it
// replaced for the next `prepare` to free. The other cells are applied to the running engine inside
// `process`, which allocates nothing. A new engine starts silent, as freeverb's own resize did.
//
// ⚠️ An engine is built when its algorithm is CHOSEN, not before: a project on algorithm 0 never
// allocates any of this.
//
// Kept behind an opaque pointer so the freeverb headers, their `LIBFV3_FLOAT` define and their
// include path stay inside one translation unit instead of reaching every file that includes the
// audio engine.
