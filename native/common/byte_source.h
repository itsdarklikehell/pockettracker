// ─── pt_fopen and friends — the one place a path string becomes a file operation ─────────────────
//
// Every touch of a user file below the UI goes through here: samples, soundfonts, projects, `.pti`
// presets, the render's own read-back, the "is this file still there?" probe — and the render's
// publish step, which deletes a stale target and renames a temp over it.
//
// A path is not always a path: a directory granted through a system picker is a URI with a scheme,
// which no libc call can touch. Which kind of string it is gets decided here, once, below every
// caller. On a host with no hooks every function is a plain libc call, and a URI fails.
//
// ⚠️ THE HOOKS ARRIVE AS ONE STRUCT, installed by one call: half-hooked, a render would write its
// temp through the host and then ask libc to rename a string libc cannot see.
//
// ⚠️ They live in `byte_source.cpp`, not an inline variable here: on Android the engine library
// reads them and the shell library installs them, and an inline variable stays single only by ELF
// interposition, which `-fvisibility=hidden` would silently break.

 * (Android: `ParcelFileDescriptor.detachFd()`, not `getFd()`).
 *
 * `mode` is the stdio mode string as given to `pt_fopen`. A write mode may CREATE, because the
 * strings that reach here are composable — the host can derive the parent and the name from the
 * path (`shell/saf-filesystem.h`). ⚠️ **Append is not required of a hook**: nothing below the UI
