 * native/ui/platform_caps.h — what THIS platform can do: which SETTINGS rows and PROJECT actions exist.
 * Half of SETTINGS is about the DEVICE (touch layouts, a skinned D-pad, button clicks and haptics, a
 * way to QUIT), and devices differ.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CAPS ARE A VALUE, NOT AN #ifdef. The same code answers every profile:
 *   • `android(debug)` reproduces the recorded golden's row map exactly, hidden rows and all, so
 *     the input tests drive it row for row;
 *   • `sdl(debug)` is what the desktop and handheld shells run;
 *   • `converged(debug)` is what the Android app runs.
 * `debug` is a field rather than `#ifdef NDEBUG` for the same reason.
