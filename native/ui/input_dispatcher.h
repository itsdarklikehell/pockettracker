// ─── THE INPUT DISPATCHER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every button, every combo, one place — the only input path for every screen. `cursor_context()`
// answers what the cursor is on, and the generic `on_a` / `on_b` / `on_a_left` / `on_a_right` /
// `on_a_b` turn a button into an `InputAction` without asking which screen is up (ui/cursor.h); what
// lives here is everything else — selection, clipboard, item cycling, cloning, the FX helper, previews.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE MODAL RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The confirm dialog, the QWERTY keyboard, the THEME and EQ editors (partial), the FX helper and the
// FILE BROWSER each OWN THE BUTTONS while up, and the order a press is offered to them is the
// specification: the keyboard can sit on top of the browser (rename) or the theme editor (its SAVE),
// and a D-pad press there must move the KEY cursor.
// ⭐ That order is written once, in `top_overlay()`; every handler asks `overlay_swallows()` with the
// layers it answers for. A modal one handler forgets is a button that silently does the wrong thing.
// ⚠️ The EQ editor is PARTIAL: it swallows the D-pad, A, B and SELECT but lets START through, so a band
// can be swept across a held INSTRUMENT audition. Every other modal swallows everything.
//
// ── Input layers ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   • `shell/sdl-input.h`  — keycodes, controller buttons, axes, key repeat. SDL's.
//   • `ui/button_mapper.h` — the COMBO MATRIX: which named handler a press means. Portable.
//   • here                 — what each named handler DOES.
// No `handle(ButtonEvent)` here: the matrix is a free function so a tool can drive it with a stub,
// and named handlers let the tests drive them one at a time.
//
// ⚠️ The clock is injected (`set_now()` once a frame), so time-dependent behaviour can be tested.
