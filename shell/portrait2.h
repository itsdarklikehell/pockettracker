// ─── shell/portrait2.{h,cpp} — the PORTRAIT2 device-skin RENDERER ────────────────────────────────
//
// On a phone held in portrait, the 640×480 tracker sits in a bezel with a vent panel above, a
// branding strip below, and a themed button cluster filling the bottom — 20:9 chrome drawn AROUND
// the frame.
//
// `touch_layout::portrait2_skin` computes the band rects and the frame-in-bezel (shared, portable
// C++); this file COMPOSITES them: casing clear, each band's PNG (from `Skin`), the frame placement
// for `SdlVideo`, and the ten buttons on the backing.
//
//   ┌───────────────┐  band 1  top vent panel   (SkinPiece::TopPanel)      — may be absent (case C)
//   │  ┌─────────┐  │  band 2  screen bezel      (SkinPiece::ScreenBezel)   — the 640×480 frame sits INSIDE
//   │  │ 640×480 │  │
//   ├──┴─────────┴──┤  band 3  branding strip    (SkinPiece::BrandingPanel) — FULL device width
//   │  [buttons...]  │  band 4  button cluster    (SkinPiece::ButtonBacking) — the ten portrait2_rects
//   └───────────────┘
//
// ── TWO KINDS OF SKIN IN ONE RENDERER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The above is the CHROME art (amiga / amiga-2). The TRANSPARENT skin is drawn by this same class from
// a different starting point: `portrait2_skin_bare` instead of `portrait2_skin`, so there are no bands
// at all — just the tracker across the FULL device width and the button cluster below it. Its art is
// the bare square and wide shapes, tinted at blit time to the live tracker theme, so two colours reach
// the screen: the theme's background, which is the casing clear, and its TXT VALUE, which is every key
// and the same labels the chrome skins draw.
//
//   ┌───────────────┐  the tracker — full device width, no bezel, no border
//   │    640×480    │
//   ├───────────────┤
//   │  [buttons...]  │  the same cluster, the same `portrait2_rects`, the same hit-test
//   └───────────────┘
//
// The CLUSTER arithmetic is shared, which is the point: only the bands around it differ, so a button
// is in the same place relative to its neighbours under either skin and `SdlTouch` needs to know
// nothing about which one is up.
//
// `cluster_rect()` / `button_rects()` expose the SAME geometry the buttons are drawn with, and
// `SdlTouch::layout_portrait2` hit-tests them — one source of truth, so a press can never highlight a
// cell the finger is not on.
