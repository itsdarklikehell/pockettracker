// ─── shell/skin.h — the touch-skin textures, decoded once and owned by the renderer ──────────────
//
// The touch skin is chrome drawn AROUND the 640×480 frame, in device-resolution space, in the
// shell's `present()` — never in the canvas. The PNGs come through the asset seam (assets.h) and the
// decoder (image.h) and are uploaded to `SDL_Texture`s here, once, at load.
//
// It is the SHELL's, and its lifetime is the RENDERER's: the textures are created from an
// `SDL_Renderer*` and must be destroyed before it is (`unload()` before `SdlVideo::close()`).
//
// ⚠️ SEMANTIC-FREE: a `SkinPiece` names the FILE, not the band it lands in. Where a piece goes is
// the renderer's knowledge (portrait2), in the code that computes the destination rects.

//                  `amiga` and `amiga-2`.
//   Transparent  — the generic button SHAPES alone, authored as white ink on transparent, and no
//                  background art: the shapes are tinted to the live theme and the characters are
//                  drawn over them in a font, in that same colour. `amiga-transparent`.
