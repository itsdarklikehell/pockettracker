// sdl-touch.{h,cpp} — the on-screen virtual gamepad (landscape).
//
// The hit-rect LAYOUT is shared, portable C++ (`native/ui/touch_layout.h`); the RENDERING is
// shell-side — the buttons are chrome drawn AROUND the letterboxed 640×480 frame, so pt-ui never
// learns a panel.
//
// This file:
//   • places the two LANDSCAPE boxes in the letterbox bars either side of the frame;
//   • turns an SDL finger into a `Button` by hit-testing the shared rects and feeds it through
//     `SdlInput`'s OWN press/release — inheriting the mods snapshot, the key-repeat engine and the
//     held-button de-dup;
//   • draws the boxes, buttons and labels with the shared 5×5 font, highlighting a held one.
//
// `layout()` draws AND hit-tests the landscape bars; `layout_portrait2()` hit-tests the PORTRAIT2
// grid, which `PortraitSkin` draws.
