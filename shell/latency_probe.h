// latency_probe.h — what the app can know about its own latency, measured rather than read.
//
// Two large terms in the latency budget are usually READINGS, not results: the wait for the app to
// look at an input, and the time an audio block spends in the output buffer. This measures the first
// and the visible half of the second, and is loud about the half it cannot see (only a microphone can).
//
// ⚠️ TWO PERIODS, BECAUSE THE LOOP HAS TWO RATES (app.cpp): the POLL period costs an input its wait;
// the FRAME period is the drawing, kept here because splitting the two could quietly wreck the second.
//
// ⚠️ A GLOBAL, NOT ON THE AUDIO SEAM: `AudioBackend` reports what the device does and carries no
// instrument, so a default-off diagnostic does not ship in it. Written with relaxed atomics from both
// threads, read once on the way out; `report` is handed the seam's latency figure.
//
// ⚠️ TWO WINDOWS: a figure taken with the transport stopped and one under a full mix are different
// claims, so every number below is binned by whether the transport was running.
//
// ⚠️ THE CALLBACK GAP IS SDL-ONLY: oboe-audio-engine.cpp is below shell/ and cannot see this header.
// Android's output figure comes through the seam instead.
//
//   POCKETTRACKER_LATENCY=1   accumulate, and print the account on exit
//
// Off by default and free when off: one cached bool ahead of every store.
